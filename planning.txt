work:
- VGA, radomisation
- decimal decoder, timer, skeleton code

debug after the code are almost done

before 6 July:
draw the interface of the game with colour.
	for 1/2 players
try writing the code for the decimal decoder, for the score and the timer
	A score: HEX[7:6]
	B score: HEX[5:4]
	timer: HEX[1:0]
try writing the timer
	count up from 0
	start when the first button click and after reset
	stop when one of the player reach the goal
try drawing the skeleton code, and FSM
	include the input, output and the connection between different parts
	the FSM state table too
figure out how to show the sqaure on specific places

on the practical(6 July):
try the VGA code
	modify and do some changes on the code.
	know well about the code
	think how to show squares on specific places
check the code for the timer and the HEX
	make sure it's working
add the reset feature

before the 13 July:
fix the problem we saw on 6 July practical
if it is avaliable, add feature -> for one player, by using a switch
if it is avaliable, add feature -> save high score time
if it is avaliable, add feature -> make it looks fancy (?)
if it is avaliable, add feature -> figure out how to do randomisation
	simple case: do randomization every 2 boxes when reset is on
	more complicate case: randomize the boxes depends on the most bottom box.

on the practica(13 July) :
check the code
debug
combine any new features and check the code again
check extreme case on score and timer

before the 20 July:
fix the problem we saw on 13 July practical
the game must be working.!!!! otherwise, just focus on the problems we got. (not adding any features)
if it is avaliable, add features.
